Potential enhancements: I would suggest to have an autocomplete API while adding new items based on previous items that's been added in the past (for example 6 months ago). 
Like when the user starts typing 'go to...' we can show an autocomplete list to choose from which is coming from the API with options like
- go to the dentist
- go to school 
- go to the gym

Also something to consider here is to show daily, weekly, monthly to do lists coming from the API when we first load the page. 
For example I can add new item 'Run 2 miles' or 'Save 10 dollars' and make that show on my app every day even after I remove it or mark it as done for today.
